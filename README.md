### Image Segmentation: Otsu’s Thresholding & Region Growing

This project demonstrates basic image segmentation techniques using synthetic images. It includes:

- Generation of a synthetic grayscale image with two distinct objects
- Addition of Gaussian noise
- Segmentation using **Otsu’s thresholding**
- Segmentation using **Region Growing** from multiple seed points
